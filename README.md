# Artifacts for A Security RISC
This repository contains the artifacts for the IEEE S&P 2023 paper ["A Security RISC: Microarchitectural Attacks on Hardware RISC-V CPUs"](https://misc0110.net/files/riscv_attacks_sp23.pdf). 


## Supported Processors and Distributions
Currently, the experiments are tested on the T-Head C906, C908, C910 and SiFive U74 processor. 
The C906 and U74 are in the paper, the others were added afterwards:

| Processor    | Board                             | Distro             | Kernel                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| T-Head C906  | Sipeed Nezha / Sipeed Lichee RV   | Debian 12          | 5.14.0-rc4-nezha (Nezha), 5.4.61 (Lichee RV) |
| T-Head C908  | CanMV Kendryte K230               | Debian 13          | 5.10.4                                       |
| T-Head C910  | BeagleV Ahead                     | Ubuntu 23.04       | 5.10.113-g52fbe8443ea1-dirty                 |
| SiFive U74   | StarFive VisionFive 2             | Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS | 5.17.5-visionfive                            |


## Utils
We provide a `rlibsc.h` header file that bundles a few useful instructions for all experiments.
To use the header, simply add `#include "rlibsc.h"` to your code, after copying the header to your path. 

## Materials
Each subfolder contains a README on how to run the specific experiment. We provide source code for the following experiments: 

### Additional Materials
- `spectre`: Spectre exploit on the C910 processor

### Case Studies
- `access-retired`: Discovers hidden files on a system by monitoring the ammount of retired instructions. This code is used during the Dropbox case study. 
- `zigzagger`: Code for the zigzagger case study showing that it is possible to distinguish the branch direction of zigzagger protected code via the count of retired instructions. 
- `aes_example`: Contains the code for all AES T-Table attacks performed. 
- `interrupt-timing`, `timer-drift`: Shows that it is possible to monitor network interrupts via timing. Also shows that a more precise result is possible using CycleDrift. 
- `page-walk`: Shows timing (and on the U74 instruction differences) that allow to distinguish the length of the page-table walk. 
- `mbedtls-key-leak`: Contains the code for the Flush+Fault exploit on MbedTLS.

### Histogram Code 
- `evict_reload_histrogram`: Generates a histrogram for an Evict+Reload covert channel 
- `fence_flush_histogram`: Generates a histrogram for an Flush+Reload attack on the I-Cache using the `fence.i` instruction.  
- `fgprime_probe_histrogram`: Optimized Prime+Probe for the C906 making use of the FIFO relacement strategy to achive highter transfer rates. 
- `iflush_reload_histogram`: Generates a Flush+Reload histogram using the `icache.iva` instruction on the C906 and C910. 
- `flush_reload_histogram`: Generates a Flush+Reload histogram using the `dcache.iva` instruction on the C906 and C910. 
- `flush_flush_histogram`: Generates a Flush+Flush histogram using the `dcache.iva` instruction on the C906 and C910. 
- `prime_probe_histogram`: Histrogram for a Prime+Probe attack. 
- `tlb_evict_histogram`: Code to genereate a histogram showing that it is possible to evict TLB entries. 
- `spectre-v1`: Histogram that shows that code is spculatively fetched, enabling our Cache+Time attack. 

### Benchmarks
- `timer-evaluation`: Benchmark for the precision and increment behavior of the timers present on the tested processors. 
-  `instr-cycles`: Shows the timing of most base set instructions  

### Misc
- `square-multiply`: Padded square and multiply implementation that is still vulnerable to an attacker that can see the number of retired instructions. 
- `m-mode-instr-count`: Shows that the `rdinstret` instruction leaks the number of exeuted instructions in M-mode. 
- `flush-fault`: PoC implementations for both variants of Fault+Fault.
