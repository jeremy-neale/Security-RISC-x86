# Evict+Reload Histogram

Prints a simple Evict+Reload histogram. 
The eviction strategy is different for the U74 and C906 as they use differenct cache replacement strategies. 

# Run
Running `make` gives two binaries, run `hist-c906` if testing on the C906 processor and `hist-u74` if testing on the U74 processor. 

# Works on 
C906, U74
